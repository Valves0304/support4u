Applied Research Final Project

At this time in COVID-19, many people are isolated in their houses. 
SupportForYou is a website where people who need help and donators can meet each other. 
The donators can provide tangible and non-tangible aids to needy people.   
This is a volunteer help website totally depending on the people who want to help those in need but need a platform. 
It makes possible to donate items, time, and care.   

This is the final project of my course COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS at Douglas College.
