    <p>At this time in COVID-19, many people are isolated in their houses.
      SupportForYou is a website where people who need help and donators can meet each other.
      The donators can provide tangible and non-tangible aids to needy people.
      This is a volunteer help website totally depending on the people who want
      to help those in need but need a platform. It makes it possible to donate items, time and care.

      Support for You is a platform created on an emergency basis to connect
      people who are willing to help other people at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19.
      Be it, for example, buying products in supermarkets and pharmacies, or just solving
      simpler things like taking the dog for a walk. The use of the platform is free,
      spread this idea and help a neighbour who needs it, to face this awkward moment.
      Together we are stronger!
